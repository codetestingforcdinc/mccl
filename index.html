    <p class="gt">Give It to Us. We Have Got 30+ Converters Waiting For You!</p>

    <p class="gth">Frequently asked Questions</p>

    <p class="qfaq">1. How does the conversion process work?</p>
    <p class="afaq">
      The conversion process depends on the specific file type being converted
      <br />
      Generally, it involves uploading the file, selecting the desired output<br />
      format, and initiating the conversion process.
    </p>

    <p class="qfaq">2. What file formats are supported for conversion?</p>
    <p class="afaq">
      Our conversion website supports a wide range of file formats, including<br />
      popular formats like PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PNG, and JPEG, among others.
      Please<br />
      check the website for a complete list of supported file formats.
    </p>

    <p class="qfaq">3. Is there a limit on the file size for conversion?</p>
    <p class="afaq">
      Yes, there may be a limit on the file size for conversion. Larger files<br />
      may take longer to process, and very large files may exceed the limits<br />
      imposed by the website. Please check the website for specific file size<br />
      restrictions.
    </p>

    <p class="qfaq">4. How long does the conversion process take?</p>
    <p class="afaq">
      The time required for conversion depends on factors such as file size,<br />
      complexity, and server load. Smaller files typically convert quickly,<br />
      while larger or more complex files may take longer. The website will<br />
      provide an estimated conversion time during the process.
    </p>

    <p class="qfaq">5. Can I convert multiple files at once?</p>
    <p class="afaq">
      Yes, our website supports batch conversions. You can select multiple
      files<br />
      for conversion and initiate the process. The website will handle the<br />
      conversions sequentially or in parallel, depending on the system<br />
      capabilities.
    </p>

    <p class="qfaq">6. Are my files secure during the conversion process?</p>
    <p class="afaq">
      We prioritize the security and privacy of your files. Our website uses<br />
      encryption protocols to ensure the safety of your data during
      transmission<br />
      and conversion. Files are deleted from our servers shortly after the<br />
      conversion process is completed.
    </p>

    <p class="qfaq">7. Do I need to install any software or plugins?</p>
    <p class="afaq">
      No, our conversion website is entirely web-based. You can access it<br />
      through a web browser without the need for any additional software or<br />
      plugins. Simply upload your file and convert it online.
    </p>

    <p class="qfaq">
      8. Can I access the converted files on different devices?
    </p>
    <p class="afaq">
      Yes, the converted files can be downloaded and accessed on any device
      with<br />
      internet access. You can save the files to your computer, smartphone,<br />
      tablet, or any other compatible device.
    </p>

    <p class="qfaq">
      9. Are there any limitations on the number of conversions I can perform?
    </p>
    <p class="afaq">
      We strive to provide a seamless conversion experience for all users.<br />
      However, there may be certain limitations on the number of conversions<br />
      allowed within a specific time period to prevent abuse or excessive<br />
      resource consumption. Check the website for any such restrictions.
    </p>

    <p class="qfaq">10. Can I convert files without an internet connection?</p>
    <p class="afaq">
      Our conversion website requires an internet connection to upload and<br />
      process files. It performs file conversions on remote servers, so an<br />
      active internet connection is necessary for the conversion process to<br />
      work.
